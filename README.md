## Advanced Lane Finding
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)


In this project, your goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video, but the main output or product we want you to create is a detailed writeup of the project.  Check out the [writeup template](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Advanced-Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup_template.md) for this project and use it as a starting point for creating your own writeup.  

Creating a great writeup:
---
A great writeup should include the rubric points as well as your description of how you addressed each point.  You should include a detailed description of the code used in each step (with line-number references and code snippets where necessary), and links to other supporting documents or external references.  You should include images in your writeup to demonstrate how your code works with examples.  

All that said, please be concise!  We're not looking for you to write a book here, just a brief description of how you passed each rubric point, and references to the relevant code :). 

You're not required to use markdown for your writeup.  If you use another method please just submit a pdf of your writeup.

# only one source code is call 'P2.ipynb'

 Camera calibration// training with camera_cal image
 
 Camera calibration// test with camera_cal-1 image and  the test_images/test1.jpg
 
 apply a  Color and Gradient combined filter
 
 warper with perspect tranform to get the bird view
 
 apply combined_filter to bird view
 
 Using shifting windows to trace the line
 
 compute the curverad and the diff_from_center
 

# use a pipline to include all process

 process the pipline on project_video_out.mp4
